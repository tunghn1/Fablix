Pattern matching
	Like predicate is used to pattern match within the search and browsing servlet. In the search servlet, if users type in a word, then the search servlet will match all titles that have that word at the beginning, middle, and end. The reason why our group chooses to match all three cases instead of only one is to cover a wider range of search. If we have matched only one of the places, then we may not give users a wide range of movie options to choose from. One weakness of this approach is that users may have more than what they actually need. For instance, if they want to search for a movie with the first word is Chief, then they will have two movies returned, including "Chief Zabu" and "Mischief Night." In the browsing servlet, if users choose a genre or letter, then we will match that word or letter at the beginning position. Since we are interested in getting data starting with that particular letter or genre, we do not match middle and end. Moreover, we do not use ILIKE predicate since it is slower than using LIKE predicate with option of using LOWER keyword to handle cases in matching. In summary, we use like predicate for pattern matching in search and browse servlet.
